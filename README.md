# README

Chopping is a simple game built with a Javascript frontend, with Rails as a backend API.
The point of the game is to chop as much wood as you can before sasquatch eats you.

The repo for the frontend can be found here
https://github.com/BornDeleuze/Chopping-Frontend

To run the game, run the server for the backend with "rails s" and the frontend with "npx serve". Then in browser navigate to localhost:5000. 

Thanks!
